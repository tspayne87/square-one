# Welcome
Welcome to the T-box server, a simple solution to creating NodeJs servers.

## Getting Started
- [Server](server.md)
- [Dependency](dependency.md)
- [Controller](controller.md)
- [Injector](injector.md)
- [Decorators](decorators.md)
- [Results](results.md)

## About
The server was created to be an alternative to other server frameworks and to also, be familiar to other language versions of MVC by using something similiar with decorators to create routes.  The project is still in active development and has not been tested in a fully live environment.
